# Git Notes

This file contains my notes on `git`.

## Start a New Project

There are two main ways to start a new project:

1. Initialize an existing (or newly-made) directory
2. Clone an existing directory (local or remote)

#### Initialize an Existing Directory

Navigate into the directory you would like git to start tracking.

	$ git init 

#### Clone an Existing Directory

Navigate to the directory in which you wish to clone the remote repository.

Get the link to the repository you want to make a local clone of. 

	$ git clone https://linktoremoterepo.com/repositoryname.git

This will clone everything from the remote repository in the current directory.
