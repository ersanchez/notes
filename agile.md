# Notes on Agile

These are my study notes for [BCS Foundation Certificate in Agile](https://www.bcs.org/get-qualified/certifications-for-professionals/agile-certifications/bcs-foundation-certificate-in-agile/).

Agile is a mindset you use when you approach a project where the environment is changing.

* working software/product over comprehensive documentation

* responding to change over following a plan
