* inspires learner to use new skills

Principles of effective learning

Components of Effective Learning Events

* Context
* Challenge

3 Phases

* preparation phase
* iterative design phase
* iterative development phase

3 Phases

* preparation phase
* iterative design phase
* iterative development phase

3 Phases - described

* preparation phase - gather background info; savvy start
* iterative design phase - project planning; additional design
* iterative development phase - design proof (functional demo); Alpha; Beta; Gold release - final deliverable

Before starting

* get background info
* get right people
* setup room

Savvy Start

* get ideas on the table from the start
* figure out what is/isn't important
* discuss, brainstorm, sketch, prototype, review ...repeat
* don't commit to a specific design, be flexible

Prototype

* focus on design not appearance
* don't spend too much time on any one thing - be ready to throw ideas away
* draw, stick figures, disposable

Review Strategy

1. set review date
2. prepare reviewers
3. collect reviewer comments
4. aggregate and prioritize comments
5. create a revision plan for next deliverable

Each comment should have:

* reviewer's name
* location in module
* description of problem
* proposed solution
